![Logo of the app](/frontend/public/android-chrome-192x192.png)

-   This is an installable PWA built using MERN stack, and it is a blogging application.
-   It is built using the Express.js framework in Node.js with the database used being the mongoDB nosql database provided by the MongoDb Atlas cloud service.
-   The frontend of the app is built using React and I have used Bootstrap classes for styling the compnents in addition to my local CSS styles.
-   It is a blog app that lets users read the existing blog posts without logging in, and lets them share their thoughts using the anonymous comment section.
-   Each comment has a unique jdenticon icon attached to it.
-   In order to write a new blog post, the user has to login using one of the social media login options provided. The react-social-login package is being used to provide the user authentication and authorization.
-   It has been deployed using Heroku and the link for the deployed app is [here](https://mern-blog-it.herokuapp.com/).
