# Blog.It

-   The project's name is **Blog.It** and it is MERN stack blogging app/platform.
-   It is built using the Express.js framework in Node.js with the database used being the mongoDB nosql database provided by the MongoDb Atlas cloud service.
-   The frontend of the app is built using React and I have used Bootstrap classes for styling the compnents in addition to my local CSS styles.
-   It is a blog app that lets users read the existing blog posts without logging in, and lets them share their thoughts using the anonymous comment section.
-   Each comment has a unique jdenticon icon attached to it.
-   In order to write a new blog post, the user has to login using one of the social media login options provided. The react-social-login package is being used to provide the user authentication and authorization.
-   It has been deployed using Heroku and the link for the deployed app is [here](https://mern-blog-it.herokuapp.com/).
-   The Github repo for the code of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Rajatm544/MERN-Blog-App).
